>Preface: This is unrelated to trading algorithms at the moment, but this is just more related to what I think about before deciding to take a position on a trade, how I hedge trades, etc. 

## Introduction

Let's face it, algorithmic trading is ultimately what will rule the market (or rules). The top experts in mathematics, statistics, and algorithm design all gather around to create algorithms that are experts at manipulating market prices and conducting arbitrage.

However, I do want to talk about the decision-making process I go through when I place trades so that I can receive some constructive criticism and hopefully 10 years down the line, I see that my thinking was elementary and naive. 

## Decision-making processes

>These ideas mostly apply to mid-large cap traded stocks. No penny stocks here! If you're interested in trading penny stocks or doing day trading, VWAP tends to be a good indicator.

_Edit: I totally forgot to talk about EMA (Exponential Moving Averages), but check them out on Investopedia as well! There are many patterns that can be identified with EMA in addition to figuring out when a stock is overextended in one direction. <- **This is actually pretty important!**_

Here are a few metrics I look for before making a decisive decision (long or short):

### 1) Support and resistance lines

In my opinion, this should be the very first thing one should look at before deciding to trade a stock.

Based on the stock, there are two types of SR lines that you might think to observe - that is either... 

- Trendline Support/Resistance
- Key Support/Resistance

Both are important to draw out on the chart in either a full year period or half a year. 

Identifying support and resistance lines sets the very basis of whether or not your trade is highly probable to be successful and profitable, in addition to maximum potential gain. 

The basic example is to buy closer to or at support (please confirm reversal trend first but I'll talk about this later) and to short sell or sell off at resistance zones when the momentum in one direction has died off. 

This is far from being an easily profitable strategy and you need more data to back this up, but I'll talk about that a bit later.

Let me introduce an example with NVDA:

![](https://www.tradingview.com/x/oAIK432C/)

>NVDA is an example of a stock that was part of the cryptocurrency burst with its competitor AMD. While NVDA has a sizeable market share in Datacenter and GPUs, it wasn't enough to stop the stock from dropping from $291 to $125 in a matter of months. 

Draw the lines based on history, and based on where the stock has bounced versus where the stock has rejected further uptrending moves. Remember that once a stock has been confirmed to have broken through resistance, this typically means that our new resistance has become new support. As an example, $162 is now our key support for NVDA.

Also, drawing the intra-monthly trend support/resistance lines allow us to see that NVDA is currently in an ascending triangle pattern. This means that the stock is closing at higher lows and highs, and is moving upwards overall. 

The stock is back on track, but there are still resistance zones to break out from. The potential breakout zones (202.79, 173.03, 161.94, 143.27) with the top 2 being resistance zones and bottom 2 being support zones show a few things.


#### I. Trading range

In the short term (intra-week), we see that it is very likely without an external catalyst that the stock will trade within the $174 - $162 zone. This is because this range is our higher and lower bound of support and resistance.

The better key piece of information to take notice of however is the trendline trading range. It is more likely that NVDA will consistently trade within that pattern, moving up and down when encountering resistance and support. The range is probably closer to that of $178 - $171.50 within the coming days.

#### II. The current price breaks resistance, but just slightly

In unexpected fashion, the stock broke through resistance. This happens more often than people think, which is precisely why people need to learn how to wait for either confirmation of the reversal or momentum decrease before making a decision that is more probable to succeed.

However, at this point in time we see that the stock did two things.

- Is approaching or at trendline resistance
- Broke through prior key resistance in 4 months

What is the probability that NVDA makes a runner here? Probably not a lot. One should understand that psychology itself would be focused on taking profits on the way to the top, and not vice versa. Even algorithms are programmed to make calculations in this manner.

The probability that NVDA does a slight drawback to the trendline support is more likely however, and then once again one has to be able to be prepared to be vigilant in analyzing which way the stock goes from there. If it continues its uptrend, buying at trendline support might prove to be a nice discount. 

I would personally short the stock in this case, albeit I haven't yet mentioned the other indicator(s) which I use to fully make this decision. 

### 2) Relative Strength Index (RSI)

>The relative strength index (RSI) is a momentum indicator that measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions in the price of a stock or other asset. The RSI is displayed as an oscillator (a line graph that moves between two extremes) and can have a reading from 0 to 100. - [Investopedia on RSI](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rsi.asp)

If the stock is being classified as overbought by RSI but it was still uptrending, would you think it is likely that it will continue to go up? Maybe it will continue to go up, but the possibility of it making an accelerated move upwards when its classified as overbought on the 6-month chart is rather low. 

Of course, sentiment may turn the stock on its head and soon enough the stock may continue to soar and reach new highs even at an overbought stage. There are many factors in play here.

**But even more so, your foundation for laying out a thesis should have a much larger share with regards to support and resistance lines.** Watch how the RSI doesn't really capture this huge move in 2 days (NVDA dropped from $200 to $144):

*Use the RSI to support your thesis, and not to change or found it.*

### 3) Fibonacci retracements

>In technical analysis, a Fibonacci retracement is created by taking two extreme points (usually a major peak and trough) on a stock chart and dividing the vertical distance by the key Fibonacci ratios of 23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8% and 100%. Once these levels are identified, horizontal lines are drawn and used to identify possible support and resistance levels. - [Investopedia on Fib. retracements](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/fibonacciretracement.asp)

![](https://www.tradingview.com/x/WxEP9D2N/)

In addition to doing trendline and key support/resistance analysis, fibonacci retracements are also great at identifying where the stock is at in terms of support/resistance levels. You can see that when the stock is trading within a decently consistent range and is not overly volatile, the stock tends to trade off the middle line. 

Personally, I find that if the supports and resistance zones matches closely with my fibonacci retracements, the reversals and predictions tend to be a tad bit more accurate (backed by more data and trading volume)

### 4) Patterns

Patterns tend to repeat themselves in the market. I did identify an ascending triangle with NVDA, but there are numerous other patterns. Namely, head and shoulders, inverse head and shoulders, descending triangle, **wedges**, and more.

#### I. Triangles

Triangles are pretty simple. Draw trendline resistance and support, keep in mind overall market sentiment, check news, and generally given that there are no external catalysts prices should continue in that direction.

**However, the triangle almost always eventually develops into a wedge.** A wedge is definitely where one has a bigger potential for earning money. Check out the next part.

#### II. Wedges

In this market, I tend to trade the bullish indicators of the market, though at this moment (March 20th, 2019), the market seems to be on the overbought side. On the polar sides of overbought and oversoldness, I find that wedges tend to breakout more than usual in the other direction.

Here's an example of a wedge with AAPL (I know there's some forward-looking bias here but I want to show an example with a frequently traded stock).

![](https://www.tradingview.com/x/lTVdmOUX/)

As you can see, **as the range within the trending resistance and support lines diminish, the price is likely going to bounce in one direction or the other.** Typically, it goes the other way from its original direction (ascending triangle into downtrend, descending triangle into uptrend). Sometimes it continues the same outlook, but that is dependent largely on news, general market sentiment (investor/trader confidence), and maybe earnings.

> Think about psychology in this case. Will people be willing to bet more money into the stock when they believe it to have grown? Traders who have already profitted would likely sell off or buy off into the other direction depending on the previous triangular trends.

### 5) News

I actually made most (and lost) most of my money through news. After going through good and bad episodes of buying and selling the news, I have come to a few conclusions. 

There are two types of news that one should pay attention to. Also keep in mind that in scenarios like this, I think as both a trader and an investor and all technical indicators are thrown out the window. 

Only historical data and a good sense of psychology will be the most beneficial in this scenario.

Anyways, here are the two types which are pretty simple:

1. Long-term damaging and potential signal of danger to the company (Blue Apron business model, Kraft-Heinz record losses, and overall decreasing in popularity)
2. Impulse news or short-term impact news (Analyst downgrade based on largely speculation, the Boeing crash, Johnson & Johnson baby powder scandal, Elon Musk being a memer)

I find that I don't really encounter the first type of news in the first place. This is mostly due to the fact that I'm just not particularly interested in those specific sectors, and I typically focus on high market share stocks such as Apple, Facebook, Nvidia, AMD, Alibaba, et cetera or I just trade the SPY.

Either way, I did pick up trading Boeing and Tesla as of late due to the recent news. In fact, I'll just lay out my theses here.

#### Deciphering impulse news

##### Johnson & Johnson Case
When Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) talked about the baby powder scandal in December 2018, the media ate it up like cake. Non-stop reporting for news coverage and revenue comes from talking about topics such as these, so that is to be expected. Surely enough, JNJ lost up to 15% of its share value within a couple weeks. 

Slowly but surely, we now see it return from $123 to $138. Why? Simply because this baby powder scandal did not pose a long-term threat to JNJ. This baby powder scandal was just one product out of thousands if not tens of thousands of JNJ products. 

##### Boeing Case
Boeing is a more recent case. 

>Emotionally, this is a tough one for me largely because it involves human lives. I simply wish the families to live the best life they can without their loved ones, and that this tragedy will pave the way for higher regulation for aircraft software and federal approval. 

But, think of it from an investor's perspective. An investor understands that Boeing holds an extremely large market share and means of production when it comes to aircraft. Nearly all major airlines operate Boeing aircraft, and not exclusively to the Boeing 737 Max Series.

As of current news, a lot of bad news have been consistently pricing in, ultimately leading to the grounding of all Boeing 737 Max aircraft until a definite resolution has been made. This will definitely cut into Boeing's earnings and revenue as the company will have to pay large penalties and deal with PR issues.

Even so, Boeing still holds consistently at $370, and I remember explicitly that the day Boeing dropped from $420 to $370, it bounced right back up to $400 in just one day. Of course, that was until bad news were only expanded upon. 

Boeing in the long-term, let's say 5-10 years from now will be slightly dented from this incident. So what does an investor think? An investor will think, "This is the time to buy Boeing at a discount!"

As a trader, specifically an options trader, this has some large implications with regards to volatility. Risk and reward, establishment of support and resistance lines, learning to scalp might make one trade profitably in this scenario.


## Progress update

I think I've definitely learned a lot since my last blog post. Looking back, I definitely changed the way I think and I'm glad for it. Also I'm not as much of a fanboy of Robinhood anymore as I am of InteractiveBrokers (mostly because Robinhood absolutely sucks at filling orders which sometimes cost me more than the cost of commissions).

### Self-criticism

Thus far, I have been able to grow $1,400 to $3,500 over the last two months while maintaining a medium-level of risk (30% account exposure to options) over the last two months. I know, pretty high percentage-wise in terms of exposure, but this is precisely due to the fact that I happen to have a relatively small account. 

Last week I was actually originally up $4,200 at one point this month. The following days, I broke my discipline of 30% account exposure to options, and overtraded. I quickly fell back to $2,500 (-$500 on Weibo, -$1000 on TSLA, -$200 on a combination of other various stocks I traded).

 Had I not been so overly optimistic and confident, and trusted in rational decision-making, I would probably have been saying I grew $1,400 to $6,000 instead. My father assured me that this was normal. Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater, went through worse tribulations than I did before building the US's largest hedge fund. You live and you learn!

I bought WB at the peak out of too much optimism and drinking too much kool-aid following an earnings dip, betted on TSLA breaking through support and heavily shorted it, and then became impatient with losing trades after. A recipe for disaster.

Did recover though, and I will keep this experience in mind in the future. Definitely will prove to be valuable when I have money in my account.

**Didn't do as well as I had hoped, but this was because I made as many good decisions as I made bad decisions. At the end of the day, it could have been worse. The rest really boiled down to luck and I really want myself to be wary of this.**

### Changing trading habits

I have swapped the time frames on all my option contracts to at the very least 1 month prior to expiration so theta decay doesn't bite me later. 

The only thing that is unfortunate about this is that you gain less money when your contract is ITM, but I really don't mind sizing down that risk as short-term contracts often times don't work out in your favor in a lot of times. 

_Giving yourself breathing room for your theory to play out even though things might be going south is what I find to be pretty crucial in being consistently profitable. I find trusting the mathematics, statistics, and indicators to be much more powerful than your gut._


## Closing remarks

These are the five things I think about before playing a stock. I never play more than 5 stocks at once, it typically takes too much time just to figure out various statistics, technical indicators, news, and market sentiment. But, please let me know if you have any other things that should be added! I will add accordingly to this post or future posts with your name added as credit.

Good luck in the markets,

David
