>Preface: This is unrelated to trading algorithms at the moment, but this is just more related to what I think about before deciding to take a position on a trade, how I hedge trades, etc. 

## Introduction

In my previous post I talked about some of the technical trading indicators that I think about before entering a trade, primarily to determine probability, opportunity flow, and risk-reward analysis. A contrarian view is key to success here and it is important to know when to separate yourself from the herd during certain situations (over-optimism, over-pessimism).

My initial plan with regards to reading trading books was primarily to boost my knowledge of the markets and to establish principles and discipline when it comes to trading. Am I willing to accept responsibility for the risks going into a trade? Can I handle being wrong? Is there another overlooked perspective I didn't consider? These were just a few questions I have everytime I lose a trade. As a result, I present forth a few books I would like to read in order to hone my future trading mindset.

> It's not whether you are right or wrong that is important. It is how much money you make when you are right and how much money you lose when you are wrong.

## Books

This will be structured primarily by listing the key takeaways from each book and how I can apply these to my everyday trading habits.

### 1) __Trading in the Zone__ by Mark Douglas (IN PROGRESS)

- **Assume full responsibility for your losses**. An external catalyst can easily turn your winning trade into a losing trade. Don't blame the market, and realize that losses happen and mature from it. Do not feel hurt, angry, or sad when you lose a trade, and do not feel overly optimistic when you win a trade.
- **Practice consistency.** Maybe you had a lucky run (totally me). But can you always have lucky runs without a plan/strategy? There has to be a basic framework for entering and exiting trades, and once that strategy is established, live and die by its rules until adjustments need to be made. Your equity curve should be relatively stable and uptrending, not a quick uptrend into a steep descent.

### 2) __Principles__ by Ray Dalio (IN PROGRESS)

- **Seek out the opinions of others.** Don't be so sure you are right. Make sure the holistic view is presented, and then make your decision. Being biased by emotions or cockiness is sure to lead to undesirable losses.


If there are any other books you think I should read and draw takeaways from, please do list them in the comments!
