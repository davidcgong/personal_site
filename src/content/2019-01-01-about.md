## A little about me

I'm currently a rising senior at the Georgia Institute of Technology majoring in Computer Science. I'm passionate about topics related to data science, algorithmic trading, full stack product development, investing, and entrepreneurship. 

My side gigs nowadays include professional-level table tennis and options trading. I was formerly among the best in my respective age groups (U10 through U18) for the USA in table tennis.

### Some of my works

- [**Verena (preliminary research link)**](https://github.com/davidcgong/stockvis), algorithmic trading strategies on QuantConnect. Currently also developing a Deep Q-Learning trading bot.
- [**Birddog.io**](http://github.com/davidcgong/Birddog.io), time-series regression forecasting on top-tier median real estate home prices.
- [**Machine Learning**](https://github.com/davidcgong/ML_Coursework/tree/master) [Papers - [Supervised Learning](https://github.com/davidcgong/ML_Coursework/blob/master/Supervised_Learning/dgong8-analysis.pdf), [Randomized Optimization](https://github.com/davidcgong/ML_Coursework/blob/master/Randomized_Optimization/dgong8-analysis.pdf)], some sets of papers and implementations done for CS 7641 at Georgia Tech.
- [**Donation Tracker**](https://www.github.com/davidcgong/donation_tracker), an Android non-profit application for CS+Social Good.
