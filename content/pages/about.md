I currently study Computer Science at the [**Georgia Institute of Technology**](http://gatech.edu) and will be an Application Engineering Intern at Sony PlayStation (Summer 2019). In the past, I have worked as a Software Engineer under contract at Siemens for half a year.

My side gigs involve primarily professional-level table tennis, options trading.

A few of my notable projects include:

- [**Verena**](https://github.com/davidcgong/stockvis), algorithmic trading with QuantConnect which includes strategies based on mean reversion, trend following, and momentum trading.
- [**Birddog.io**](http://github.com/davidcgong/Birddog.io), time-series regression forecasting on top-tier median real estate home prices for every state. [Read my blog post](/blog/real-estate-prices-regression-with-scikit-learn) here.
- [**Machine Learning**](https://github.com/davidcgong/ML_Coursework/tree/master/Supervised_Learning) [[Supervised Learning](https://github.com/davidcgong/ML_Coursework/tree/master/Supervised_Learning) / [Paper](https://github.com/davidcgong/ML_Coursework/raw/master/Supervised_Learning/dgong8-analysis.pdf)], some and to-be sets of papers and implementations/projects done for CS 7/4641 (Machine Learning) at Georgia Tech.
- [**Donation Tracker**](https://www.github.com/davidcgong/donation_tracker), an Android application for CS+Social Good that tracks donation items between locations in Atlanta. Served as project manager.
- **Tradeart (my entrepreneurial venture)**, a predictive trading analytics platform.

I'm currently open to any questions, suggestions, and inquiries. As of this moment I am looking for either Fall 2019 internships or full-time jobs post-December 2019. 

The best way to get in touch with me is emailing me at [davidcgong@gatech.edu](mailto:davidcgong@gatech.edu).
