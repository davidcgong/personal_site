>This blog post is mostly for me personally as a way to reflect on my entire life, and to put myself in the right mindset looking forward into adulthood. To get a much more concise and professional gist, please read the [about me](../about) section on my personal homepage!

My life started in late 1998, when I was born into a first-generation immigrant Chinese family that consisted of my father, my mother, my older sister, and finally me.

Like many immigrants in the U.S., my parents sacrificed a higher standard of life in their country to pursue the American dream, going from selling vases on the street and working tirelessly in restaurants, to finally being able to use their higher education degrees, secure high-paying jobs, and make good investments and deals. I'm forever grateful to America and my parents for being forgiving towards me and choosing to come to America.

With that said, let's dive in!

## Early childhood in [Irvine, CA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irvine,_California) (age 0 - 5)

Even though I'm 20 (at the time of writing this), I still remember some days in California. I watched [Dora the Explorer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dora_the_Explorer) almost everyday when I was 4 years old. In kindergarten, I went to [College Park Elementary School](https://www.google.com/maps/place/College+Park+Elementary+School/@33.7059065,-117.7948362,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x80dcdc677bc10b5b:0xb29814546654fc0c!8m2!3d33.7059065!4d-117.7926475) in Irvine, California. I remember I used to always hang out with a boy named Matthew. I also remember consciously encountering a dog for the first time in my life and "running for my life" from a dog that just probably wanted to play with me. Soon after, our family made a small detour at Bermuda for 6 months.

## A prolonged vacation in [Bermuda](https://gotobermuda.com) (age 6 - 6.5 years)

Swallowed a tooth. Almost drowned in the ocean. Went snorkeling. Went diving in crystal-clear blue water and petted an eel (though I was scared there were sharks in the water). That's about it! **One of the most enjoyable times of my life even though everything was expensive.**

## The move to [Atlanta, GA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta)! (age 6.5 - 12 years old)

You may have noticed that this time period only includes up to 12 years old. More on that later! My school life during this entire time period was rather uneventful. But finally this was the time period in which the most significant life event happened to me. I started playing the sport of [table tennis.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_tennis)

![](/media/DavidGong.jpg)

I still vividly remember how my father brought me to a table tennis tournament and showed off his skills. What I didn't know was that he played semi-professionally in China as a member of the city team. For the next two years, after my dad came back from work I would play table tennis with him for hours in the basement.

I then trained with some of the top coaches in the U.S. over the next few years, eventually becoming a Joola sponsored athlete and becoming one of the best cadet and junior players nationwide. **Here are a few things that I'm somewhat proud of.**

1. U10 #1 in the U.S.
2. U12 #4 in the U.S.
3. Joola Sponsored Athlete (2007-2011)
4. 2010 Atlanta Fall Open Finalist
5. Broke 2200 rating at age 12 (professional-level)

While in school, I became known as **"Ping-Pong Gong"**.

However, a disappointing performance at the 2010 U.S. Nationals (worst day of my life thus far with the 'so close yet so far analogy') caused me and my family to make a decision - **to go back to China to train for one entire year to prepare for next year's Nationals.**

## Training period in [Wuhan, China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan) (age 12 - 13 years old)

**This period taught me more in life than anything**. The most important thing I learned was perspective. Living in the dorms with boys in a rather pungent environment can really teach you a thing or two about being grateful for what we have in the States. Even worse was training 8-9 hours a day, with underperformers being physically beaten by coaches. **It was by far an experience I will never forget as long as I live.**

Having to run 3 miles a day in under 19 minutes every 2 or 3 days (also known as the é•¿è·‘ / _changpao_) was the most dreadful physical exercise of them all. I learned by the end that I'd rather get slapped by a metal ruler 100 times over doing the run. There was a lot of physical and mental pain in China, but also a lot of comraderie between everyone, so I ultimately grew a lot from the experience.

Food was just too delicious though. I'll never forget that the next time I visit.

## Return to Atlanta (age 13 - 15 years old)

And we're back! Even though I didn't go to an international school in China, I actually ended up making better grades and got straight A's for the first time in my life. I was also fortunate enough to not have been held back a grade. My Mandarin improved immensely to the point that I started speaking it to my friends out of habit even when I came back to America.

**China matured me years ahead than if I had stayed in America**, so even though I missed out on "quality" education, I'm glad for the choice I made back then.

But of course, there was the matter of the 2011 U.S. Nationals to attend to.

**To keep it short, I botched it**. Even after all that specialized training I did, I still didn't get over my nerves. I may have been a better player fundamentally, but not mentally.

Looking back at my childhood, I was always too scared to do anything. Too scared to go to the movies because the sound was too loud (I'm that little kid that cries during movies), too scared of criticism, just scared to take initiative.

In the end, losing really did it in for me. Even after losing, I held onto the sport for two more years, but I couldn't break a wall no matter how hard I trained. **My table tennis journey was halted**. At least for now.

## Table tennis intermission (age 15 - 18 years old)

A brief intermission here allowed me to slowly rejuvenate my interest in table tennis. Though initially, when I lost table tennis, I felt that I had lost a big part of my identity. As a high school student, I didn't really know how to craft an identity. I didn't really know who I was without the sport. I was your average Asian, did decent in school and that was about it.

High school, though better than middle school, was blander than I thought and a means to end to get into a good university. I didn't really set goals for myself anymore. I sometimes valued 'me' time so much that I shrugged off people. I still don't really know what to think of it to this day.

Worst of all, during this time period I always had a feeling that I had let down so many people, but mostly myself.

Not going to lie, high school was not an enjoyable experience for me.

But then, I enrolled at Georgia Tech, and thus far **I chose to use this failure of the past to help guide me to a new and better path**.

## Going to Georgia Tech (age 18 - 20 years old)

Going here was one of the better decisions I've made in my life. So far I have done better than I thought I would. I've met many extraordinarily intelligent people from around the world. During the time of writing this, I have two semesters left until graduation, and I'll be honest, I think I may actually miss this place more than I think.

Also, thanks to a few friends, **table tennis hasn't ended for me just yet**. I joined the GT Table Tennis Club and helped improve the overall level of the club. I've helped develop the skillsets of various players around the club and I'm very proud of many players for vastly improving their skills throughout the semesters.

Making it to the Olympics seems like a dream once I look at it now. No regrets, because even though **dreams are seldom realized, that's what makes the realization of a dream so great and powerful.**

Georgia Tech was not all sunshine and flowers, obviously (**consistent all-nighters, balancing extracurriculars and entrepreneurship**). Overall, however, I was able to not stray from my path **through keeping a strong mindset and goal in mind** - to one day have enough money to buy myself a beautiful [500-acre island in the Carribean Islands.](https://www.privateislandsonline.com/search?view%5Bmap%5D=0&availability=sale&region=caribbean&q=&price_range=0%3A50000000&size_range=0%3A1000) Here's hoping to an affluent life from entrepreneurship and investing. ðŸ¤ž

## Message to future me as a 20 year old

Remember your failures and be grateful they happened. Be proud of how they matured you, enlightened you, shocked you, and how it only made you become even hungrier to succeed. Be proud that you overcame the difficulties you faced. Sometimes it's okay to take a break, because you'll come back twice as motivated and twice as focused.

The only sin you can commit is to never learn from failure. Realize that failure is the only requirement for true success. The proudest you can be is when you fail countless times, only to taste the fruits of success at the end of it all.

## Future posts?

I will definitely be doing future posts in my free time about any programming projects! Some more personal blogs for reflection are also due for in the near future.
