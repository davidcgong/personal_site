While NVDA has a sizeable market share in Datacenter and GPUs, it wasn't enough to stop the stock from dropping from $291 to $125 in a matter of months. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Draw the lines based on history, and based on where the stock has bounced versus where the stock has rejected further uptrending moves. Remember that once a stock has been confirmed to have broken through resistance, this typically means that our new resistance has become new support. As an example, $162 is now our key support for NVDA.</p>\n<p>Also, drawing the intra-monthly trend support/resistance lines allow us to see that NVDA is currently in an ascending triangle pattern. This means that the stock is closing at higher lows and highs, and is moving upwards overall. </p>\n<p>The stock is back on track, but there are still resistance zones to break out from. The potential breakout zones (202.79, 173.03, 161.94, 143.27) with the top 2 being resistance zones and bottom 2 being support zones show a few things.</p>\n<h4 id=\"i-trading-range\"><a href=\"#i-trading-range\" aria-label=\"i trading range permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>I. Trading range</h4>\n<p>In the short term (intra-week), we see that it is very likely without an external catalyst that the stock will trade within the $174 - $162 zone. This is because this range is our higher and lower bound of support and resistance.</p>\n<p>The better key piece of information to take notice of however is the trendline trading range. It is more likely that NVDA will consistently trade within that pattern, moving up and down when encountering resistance and support. The range is probably closer to that of $178 - $171.50 within the coming days.</p>\n<h4 id=\"ii-the-current-price-breaks-resistance-but-just-slightly\"><a href=\"#ii-the-current-price-breaks-resistance-but-just-slightly\" aria-label=\"ii the current price breaks resistance but just slightly permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>II. The current price breaks resistance, but just slightly</h4>\n<p>In unexpected fashion, the stock broke through resistance. This happens more often than people think, which is precisely why people need to learn how to wait for either confirmation of the reversal or momentum decrease before making a decision that is more probable to succeed.</p>\n<p>However, at this point in time we see that the stock did two things.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is approaching or at trendline resistance</li>\n<li>Broke through prior key resistance in 4 months</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What is the probability that NVDA makes a runner here? Probably not a lot. One should understand that psychology itself would be focused on taking profits on the way to the top, and not vice versa. Even algorithms are programmed to make calculations in this manner.</p>\n<p>The probability that NVDA does a slight drawback to the trendline support is more likely however, and then once again one has to be able to be prepared to be vigilant in analyzing which way the stock goes from there. If it continues its uptrend, buying at trendline support might prove to be a nice discount. </p>\n<p>I would personally short the stock in this case, albeit I haven't yet mentioned the other indicator(s) which I use to fully make this decision. </p>\n<h3 id=\"2-relative-strength-index-rsi\"><a href=\"#2-relative-strength-index-rsi\" aria-label=\"2 relative strength index rsi permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>2) Relative Strength Index (RSI)</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The relative strength index (RSI) is a momentum indicator that measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions in the price of a stock or other asset. The RSI is displayed as an oscillator (a line graph that moves between two extremes) and can have a reading from 0 to 100. - <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rsi.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Investopedia on RSI</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If the stock is being classified as overbought by RSI but it was still uptrending, would you think it is likely that it will continue to go up? Maybe it will continue to go up, but the possibility of it making an accelerated move upwards when its classified as overbought on the 6-month chart is rather low. </p>\n<p>Of course, sentiment may turn the stock on its head and soon enough the stock may continue to soar and reach new highs even at an overbought stage. There are many factors in play here.</p>\n<p><strong>But even more so, your foundation for laying out a thesis should have a much larger share with regards to support and resistance lines.</strong> Watch how the RSI doesn't really capture this huge move in 2 days (NVDA dropped from $200 to $144):</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/boJTTHuo/\"></p>\n<p><em>Use the RSI to support your thesis, and not to change or found it.</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"3-fibonacci-retracements\"><a href=\"#3-fibonacci-retracements\" aria-label=\"3 fibonacci retracements permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>3) Fibonacci retracements</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In technical analysis, a Fibonacci retracement is created by taking two extreme points (usually a major peak and trough) on a stock chart and dividing the vertical distance by the key Fibonacci ratios of 23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8% and 100%. Once these levels are identified, horizontal lines are drawn and used to identify possible support and resistance levels. - <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/fibonacciretracement.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Investopedia on Fib. retracements</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/WxEP9D2N/\"></p>\n<p>In addition to doing trendline and key support/resistance analysis, fibonacci retracements are also great at identifying where the stock is at in terms of support/resistance levels. You can see that when the stock is trading within a decently consistent range and is not overly volatile, the stock tends to trade off the middle line. </p>\n<p>Personally, I find that if the supports and resistance zones matches closely with my fibonacci retracements, the reversals and predictions tend to be a tad bit more accurate (backed by more data and trading volume)</p>\n<h3 id=\"4-patterns\"><a href=\"#4-patterns\" aria-label=\"4 patterns permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>4) Patterns</h3>\n<p>Patterns tend to repeat themselves in the market.

Wedges</h4>\n<p>In this market, I tend to trade the bullish indicators of the market, though at this moment (March 20th, 2019), the market seems to be on the overbought side. On the polar sides of overbought and oversoldness, I find that wedges tend to breakout more than usual in the other direction.</p>\n<p>Here's an example of a wedge with AAPL (I know there's some forward-looking bias here but I want to show an example with a frequently traded stock).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/lTVdmOUX/\"></p>\n<p>As you can see, <strong>as the range within the trending resistance and support lines diminish, the price is likely going to bounce in one direction or the other.</strong> Typically, it goes the other way from its original direction (ascending triangle into downtrend, descending triangle into uptrend). Sometimes it continues the same outlook, but that is dependent largely on news, general market sentiment (investor/trader confidence), and maybe earnings.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Think about psychology in this case. Will people be willing to bet more money into the stock when they believe it to have grown? Traders who have already profitted would likely sell off or buy off into the other direction depending on the previous triangular trends.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"5-news\"><a href=\"#5-news\" aria-label=\"5 news permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>5) News</h3>\n<p>I actually made most (and lost) most of my money through news. After going through good and bad episodes of buying and selling the news, I have come to a few conclusions. </p>\n<p>There are two types of news that one should pay attention to. Also keep in mind that in scenarios like this, I think as both a trader and an investor and all technical indicators are thrown out the window. </p>\n<p>Only historical data and a good sense of psychology will be the most beneficial in this scenario.</p>\n<p>Anyways, here are the two types which are pretty simple:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Long-term damaging and potential signal of danger to the company (Blue Apron business model, Kraft-Heinz record losses, and overall decreasing in popularity)</li>\n<li>Impulse news or short-term impact news (Analyst downgrade based on largely speculation, the Boeing crash, Johnson &#x26; Johnson baby powder scandal, Elon Musk being a memer)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I find that I don't really encounter the first type of news in the first place. This is mostly due to the fact that I'm just not particularly interested in those specific sectors, and I typically focus on high market share stocks such as Apple, Facebook, Nvidia, AMD, Alibaba, et cetera or I just trade the SPY.</p>\n<p>Either way, I did pick up trading Boeing and Tesla as of late due to the recent news. In fact, I'll just lay out my theses here.</p>\n<h4 id=\"deciphering-impulse-news\"><a href=\"#deciphering-impulse-news\" aria-label=\"deciphering impulse news permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Deciphering impulse news</h4>\n<h5 id=\"johnson--johnson-case\"><a href=\"#johnson--johnson-case\" aria-label=\"johnson  johnson case permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Johnson &#x26; Johnson Case</h5>\n<p>When Johnson &#x26; Johnson (JNJ) talked about the baby powder scandal in December 2018, the media ate it up like cake. Non-stop reporting for news coverage and revenue comes from talking about topics such as these, so that is to be expected. Surely enough, JNJ lost up to 15% of its share value within a couple weeks. </p>\n<p>Slowly but surely, we now see it return from $123 to $138. Why? Simply because this baby powder scandal did not pose a long-term threat to JNJ. This baby powder scandal was just one product out of thousands if not tens of thousands of JNJ products. </p>\n<h5 id=\"boeing-case\"><a href=\"#boeing-case\" aria-label=\"boeing case permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Boeing Case</h5>\n<p>Boeing is a more recent and much, much more tragic case, where hundreds of people have lost their lives due to a software bug in the angle of attack system. Still, even with this tragic event we can still see the resilience of Boeing as a company that might even get more investors to invest in the company in the long-run. The reasoning being that if even a tragic case such as this was not enough to send a large amount of investors from selling off the stock, the company is <strong>almost</strong> certainly clear for the skies in the long-run.</p>\n<p>An investor understands that Boeing holds an extremely large market share and means of production when it comes to aircraft. Nearly all major airlines operate Boeing aircraft, and not exclusively to the Boeing 737 Max Series.</p>\n<p>As of current news, a lot of bad news have been consistently pricing in, ultimately leading to the grounding of all Boeing 737 Max aircraft until a definite resolution has been made. This will definitely cut into Boeing's earnings and revenue as the company will have to pay large penalties and deal with PR issues.</p>\n<p>Even so, Boeing still holds consistently at $370, and I remember explicitly that the day Boeing dropped from $420 to $370, it bounced right back up to $400 in just one day. Of course, that was until bad news were only expanded upon. </p>\n<p>Boeing in the long-term, let's say 5-10 years from now will be slightly dented from this incident. So what does an investor think? An investor will think, \"This is the time to buy Boeing at a discount!\"</p>\n<p>As a trader, specifically an options trader, this has some large implications with regards to volatility. Risk and reward, establishment of support and resistance lines, learning to scalp might make one trade profitably in this scenario.</p>\n<h5 id=\"tesla-case\"><a href=\"#tesla-case\" aria-label=\"tesla case permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Tesla Case</h5>\n<p>Elon Musk likes to talk smack and knock the price down, and Tesla's metrics has not been so stellar either, leading to an astounding loss in the stock's value over the last few months. Yet, TSLA shows time and time again that so many investors love to buy the stock as much as short-sellers love to short the stock even in the face of bad news. What does this mean? Eventually, I believe the longs will win out over the shorts unless more bad news happens. Improbable, but certainly possible. </p>\n<h2 id=\"progress-update\"><a href=\"#progress-update\" aria-label=\"progress update permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Progress update</h2>\n<p>I think I've definitely learned a lot since my last blog post.

I know, pretty high percentage-wise in terms of exposure, but this is precisely due to the fact that I happen to have a relatively small account. </p>\n<p>Last week I was actually originally up $4,200 at one point this month. The following days, I broke my discipline of 30% account exposure to options, and overtraded. I quickly fell back to $2,500 (-$500 on Weibo, -$1000 on TSLA, -$200 on a combination of other various stocks I traded).</p>\n<p> Had I not been so overly optimistic and confident, and trusted in rational decision-making, I would probably have been saying I grew $1,400 to $6,000 instead. My father assured me that this was normal. Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater, went through worse tribulations than I did before building the US's largest hedge fund. You live and you learn!</p>\n<p>I bought WB at the peak out of too much optimism from my previous winning trades, betted on TSLA breaking through support and heavily shorted it, and then became impatient with losing trades after. A recipe for disaster.</p>\n<p>I may have managed to recover, but I will keep this experience in mind in the future. Definitely will prove to be valuable when I have more money in my account.</p>\n<p><strong>Didn't do as well as I had hoped, but this was because I made as many good decisions as I made bad decisions.
