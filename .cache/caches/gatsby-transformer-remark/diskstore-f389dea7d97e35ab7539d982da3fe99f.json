Just leaving this here for old time's sake so I can facepalm</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A democratization of the entire investing industry, <a href=\"https://robinhood.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Robinhood</a> is definitely one of the best applications I have come across in terms of investing. As a college student looking to get his feet wet with investing, Robinhood was the perfect application for me to start my venture with less risk. There was no need to pay steeping $7.00 commissions per open and close.</p>\n<p>I do want to attribute some of my success, however to luck. I made a few earning call plays when it came to options and I made a significant amount of money off of some good \"bets\", albeit without sacrificing too much of my account value.</p>\n<p>In order to reduce financial risk, I started off with $1,400 (added $400 again at some point), and within one month of doing options trading was able to raise that value to $2,850 while minimizing 30% exposure of the account value for options trading.\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/F6zZIY1.png\" alt=\"1-month growth of small account\"> </p>\n<p>This would be a lot if I had a bigger account, but as I'm starting off with a small sum of money, this is perfectly fine.</p>\n<p>But before we get into any of the trades that occurred and some of the things I have learned, here are a few key important attitudes that I have developed through experience:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Take reasonable returns when presented</strong>. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>As a trader, you are only right for so long. Factoring in theta/time decay and consolidations in stock pricing, it is important to not be too greedy.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Strategies are key for consistent account growth</strong>. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Naked calls and puts are okay, but for lower-risk plays with decent returns, strategies such as straddles, strangles, spreads, and iron condors are much better for overall account growth over time.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Play the probability game.</strong> </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Reading up on news, observing moving average candlesticks are effective here, trading off the MACD, and buying and shorting based on support and resistance lines are potential points to consider when taking a position.</p>\n<p>I'll go over these three points based on some anecdotes and how I lost the potential for a lot of money while also losing some money. </p>\n<p>At the same time, I will also go over what made trading this month successful. At the end of the day, however, locking in consistent profits in green is of most importance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"taking-reasonable-returns\"><a href=\"#taking-reasonable-returns\" aria-label=\"taking reasonable returns permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Taking reasonable returns</h2>\n<p>Before talking about when to draw the line when it comes to taking returns and how to make an accurate prediction of when the stock will rebound or consolidate, I'd like to first talk about behavioral finance and a probable reason why it kills off the profits of so many traders.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you are interested in learning about behavioral finance and financial markets in general, I highly recommend watching <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/financial-markets-global\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Financial Markets by Yale University on Coursera.</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is human nature to be optimistic during times of success and pessimistic during times of strife. This is the reason why bull markets and bear markets exist.</p>\n<p>This is a psychological phenomenon that can be observed not only on a yearly basis, but also on a daily basis. Even the very best stocks with the biggest potential for growth go under consolidation at one point before moving back up.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.investopedia.com/thmb/4eMKr38NX2vVHUe2XIoe-UblkyY=/1400x622/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/spychart08312017-5bfd6a4346e0fb0051b53a4e\" alt=\"SPY pullbacks on an uptrend\"></p>\n<p>Pullbacks sucks for the investor, but as a trader, being able to capitalize on volatility is the most important skill to have.

Theta decay A.K.A time decay</h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://theoptionprophet.com/images/Theta_Picture1.jpg\" alt=\"Scary stuff...\"></p>\n<p>As you can see, the decay of the options contract value is exponential as the date to expiration gets closer. This is because the likelihood of a contract hitting the at the money price gets lower and lower as time goes on. </p>\n<p>What does this mean then? If you are trading weekly options, there's going to be some trouble if you wait too long to execute your option. I always give at least two weeks until expiration for my contracts and at the latest (unless something interesting occurs) execute them one week later. </p>\n<p>If I had a bigger account, I would definitely buy contracts which have longer time frames for execution.</p>\n<h4 id=\"2-good-luck-being-able-to-time-a-continuing-uptrend-correctly\"><a href=\"#2-good-luck-being-able-to-time-a-continuing-uptrend-correctly\" aria-label=\"2 good luck being able to time a continuing uptrend correctly permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>2. Good luck being able to time a continuing uptrend correctly...</h4>\n<p>The market is unpredictable all the time. Chances are if a stock grew 10-15% over the few days, price correction is going to happen. So what should you probably do?</p>\n<p>Take the profits (10-15% has huge implications for the price of a contract) and be ready for the trend reversal based on your outlook (bullish or bearish).</p>\n<h4 id=\"3-what-if-there-is-high-volatility\"><a href=\"#3-what-if-there-is-high-volatility\" aria-label=\"3 what if there is high volatility permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>3. What if there is high volatility?</h4>\n<p>A little bit off topic from talking about taking in reasonable returns, but going back on what I said about expiration dates, I would also like to note an exception.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So, why wouldn't theta decay destroy the price of my contract? This is because of IV in certain cases, more specifically earnings.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>At least 30% of the gains I have made off this month have been from pre-earning plays, where I capitalize on the high IV (implied volatility) prior to the earnings announcement and then sell right beforehand. A lot of times for these options, I buy them on the same week as earnings. To understand why theta decay does not severely impact the price of an option contract during earnings week, take a look at the following Black-Scholes model used for pricing contracts. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.investopedia.com/blackscholes.png\" alt=\"Black-Scholes Model. Note that volatility is valued more than time in this formula.\"></p>\n<p>As can be observed from the formula, contracts will have extremely high premiums during times of volatility. This volatility, combined with the knowledge of general sentiment towards a stock prior to earnings, provides great opportunity for profitable plays. </p>\n<p><strong>My personal favorite strategy here is a close to the strike price <a href=\"https://www.optionsplaybook.com/option-strategies/long-strangle/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">long strangle</a>, which is position neutral.</strong> As long as the stock goes up or down a good amount, I earn money. This strategy has consistently netted me 20-30% returns on my contracts prior to earnings. </p>\n<p>If I'm feeling confident about the sentiment behind a stock prior to earnings, I will even do naked calls and puts. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Now don't hold them during earnings, because something called a <a href=\"https://www.markettamer.com/blog/beware-of-implied-volatility-crush\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">IV Crush</a> will happen.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And on a final note with regards to <strong>taking reasonable returns</strong>, it is perfectly fine to ride the wave. Just remember that waves must crash down at some point, rather that be intra-day, intra-month, or intra-year. Always be ready.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HR7p_v-YmCuLNnRIc4TqrqvPV6o=/0x0:1599x1106/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:1599x1106):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4002314/china-graphics_aug26.0.jpg\" alt=\"That&#x27;s gotta hurt...\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"strategies-for-trading-options\"><a href=\"#strategies-for-trading-options\" aria-label=\"strategies for trading options permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Strategies for trading options</h2>\n<p>Now I'm not going to get too into depth on trading strategies, since I'm not too familiar with the concept myself, but one thing to note is that due to my account size, I rarely trade iron condors, butterflies, and spreads which often require a lot of starting capital (at least in Robinhood) since selling puts and calls requires initial capital. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.optionsplaybook.com/media/images/plays/long_strangle_big.png\" alt=\"Long strangle profit/loss graph\"></p>\n<p>So, I trade long strangles and straddles for the most part. Once I manage to obtain more money, I plan to sell puts on stocks I seek to enter a position in stocks with high EV and growth potential (ideally MSFT, AAPL, FB, and more).</p>\n<p>However, what I can say is that volatility is a dream for people who trade strangles. Picking the stocks with a lot of volatility, combined with the ability to liquidate contracts when needed is often a ripe recipe for consistent profits. Post-earning strangles have been amazing at providing sharp returns, at least for this month.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Also, February is generally the most volatile month for trading.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"playing-the-probability-game\"><a href=\"#playing-the-probability-game\" aria-label=\"playing the probability game permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Playing the probability game</h2>\n<p>Always think about the probability of a stock gapping down and gapping up. <a href=\"https://optionalpha.com/13-stock-chart-patterns-that-you-cant-afford-to-forget-10585.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Patterns</a> also happen quite often intraday and intraweek.
